# QuantumAccelerator

QuantumAccelerator is a free and open source application to easily manage Windows 10 in one place.
With this application I want to allow less tech experienced people to be able to manage their computer, especially when it comes to privacy. It isn't made with only less tech experienced people in mind, it accelerates the process of managing the operating system for everyone, and more advanced features will be added later.

Managing files and privacy settings is heavily trust based and in my opinion should be available to everyone. That's why this application is completely free and open source. (the code won't be perfectly clean, because I am still learning a lot about coding) suggestions for improvement are always welcome ðŸ˜‰


## Features:
   * Free storage
   * Debloat Windows 10 (delete preinstalled apps)
   * Manage privacy settings
   * Gamebooster
   * Advanced:
     * Monitor CPU (load and temperature)
     * CPU stress test
     * Zip bomb detector
     * Create restore points

## Screenshots

Will be added soon!

## QA

 * **How do I install QuantumAccelerator?**

Just download the jar from releases, to be able to run it you'll need JavaFX (Openjfx) installed. If you have not installed JavaFX you can download the installer which is bigger but doesnt need Java or JavaFX installed and utilizes an Windows executable file wich can be run as administrator more easily.

* **Some features do not work properly, what should I do?**

Some actions like measuring CPU temp, deleting files and some more require admin permissions to properly work. Make sure you're runnning QuantumAccelerator as admin, in case your problem still persists, please report it to us with a detailed description of your problem.

* **What are the system requirements?**

**Operating system**: *Windows 10*

**Java**: *Java 8 or newer with JavaFX/Openjfx (Java 8 is recommmended, because it comes with JavaFX)*

**CPU/GPU**: *Any capable of running Windows 10*
