# QuantumAccelerator

QuantumAccelerator is a free and open source application to easily manage Windows 10 in one place.
With this application I want to enable less tech experienced people to be able, to easily manage their OS, especially its privacy settings. It isn't made with only less tech experienced people in mind, it accelerates the process of managing the OS for everyone and more advanced features will be added later.

Managing files and privacy settings is heavily trust based and in my opinion should be available to everyone, that's why this application is completely free and open source (the code won't be perfectly clean, because I am still learning a lot about coding [suggestions for improvement are always welcome ðŸ˜‰ ])

## QA

**How do I install QuantumAccelerator?**

At the moment you'll need to download the jar from releases, but to be able to run it you'll need JavaFX (Openjfx) installed. But I am working on an installer which will eliminate the need to have JavaFX installed.

**What are the system requirements?**

**Operating system**: *Windows 10*

**Java**: *Java 8 or newer with JavaFX/Openjfx (Java 8 is recommmended, because it comes with JavaFX)*

**CPU/GPU**: *Any capable of running Windows 10*
