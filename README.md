## QA

**How do I install QuantumAccelerator?**

At the moment you'll need to download the jar from releases, but to be able to run it you'll need JavaFX (Openjfx) installed. But I am working on an installer which will eliminate the need to have JavaFX installed.

**What are the system requirements?**

**Operating system**: *Windows 10*

**Java**: *Java 8 or newer with JavaFX/Openjfx (Java 8 is recommmended, because it comes with JavaFX)*

**CPU/GPU**: *Any capable of running Windows 10*
