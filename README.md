QuantumAccelerator is a free and open source application to easily manage Windows 10 in one place.
With this application I want to allow less tech experienced people to be able to manage their computer, especially when it comes to privacy. It isn't made with only less tech experienced people in mind, it accelerates the process of managing the operating system for everyone, and more advanced features will be added later.

Managing files and privacy settings is heavily trust based and in my opinion should be available to everyone. That's why this application is completely free and open source. (the code won't be perfectly clean, because I am still learning a lot about coding) suggestions for improvement are always welcome ðŸ˜‰

## Why QuantumAccelerator?
Are you bored of other "boosters" stating to boost your computer by over 100%, charging you money to unlock all features, promising things that will never happen even if you pay them? Then QuantumAccelerator is the application you need. It's completely free and I mean it, no pay walls, no ads or annoying popups and no personal data being collected. QuantumAccelerator might not be the fastest solution, but it doesn't promise things that will never happen, and its being improved over time.

## Features:
   * Free storage
   * Debloat Windows 10 (delete preinstalled apps)
   * Manage privacy settings
   * Gamebooster
   * Advanced:
     * Monitor CPU (load and temperature)
     * CPU stress test
     * Zip bomb detector
     * Create restore points

## QA

 * **How do I install QuantumAccelerator?**

Download the installer, which doesnt need Java or JavaFX installed and utilizes a Windows executable file wich can easily be run as administrator (needed for all features to work). You can also download QuantumAccelerator from Sourceforge just click on the button bellow.


* **Some features do not work properly, what should I do?**

Some actions like measuring CPU temp, deleting files and some more require admin permissions to properly work. Make sure you're running QuantumAccelerator as admin, in case your problem still persists, please report it to me with a detailed description of your problem through issues or on the official Discord server. Also make sure to set your PowerShell execution policies to "RemoteSigned".

* **What are the system requirements?**

**Operating system**: *Windows 10*

**CPU/GPU**: *Any capable of running Windows 10*

**Supported languages:** *English, German, French*

* **How can I compile QuantumAccelerator myself?**

Open the code in NetBeans IDE 8.2 and compile it from there. If you want an exe file use the command "mvn jfx:native" (get more info about Zenjava Maven plugin from <a href="https://github.com/javafx-maven-plugin/javafx-maven-plugin" URL>here</a>) with Java JDK 1.8. If you want to create an installer with <a href="https://github.com/jrsoftware/issrc" URL>INNO Setup</a> yourself, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/JannisJost/QuantumAccelerator/tree/master/installer" URL>installer folder</a>.
